# Overall File Structure 

assets folder includes timeline SVGs (divised in 3 separate parts)
css folder includes 4 different style files in order to avoid committing to master

### Comments

Do not modify data points structure!
Commit as much as you can!
Be careful with the SVGs as they have been modified manually in order to fit!
