# Overall File Structure 

- Assets folder includes timeline SVGs ( divised in 3 separate parts );
- It also includes the svg-icons folder;
- Sass folder includes 4 different style files in order to avoid committing to master ( _animation-n.scss );
- Javascript file includes classes and ids used in SVG;
- Some of them are dynamically added;

### Comments

- Do not modify data points structure!
- Commit as much as you can!
- Be careful with the SVGs as they have been modified manually in order to fit!
- Work on branches!
